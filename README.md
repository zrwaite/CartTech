        "Grocery Shopping is a repetive, menial task, which means it is ripe for automation. Also, as we learned in the past 2 years, having these warehouse-like stores as a congregation point comes with many drawbacks. CartTech is here to make the process easier than ever.

## Project Description 📝:

We decided to make CartTech, a grocery shopping cart and web app which allows users to purchase groveries by driving a cart around a store, all from the ease and comfort of their own home. Grocery shopping is something that all of us must do, but is repetitive and has the potential for automation.

(What we decided to do)
(Research behind it)

(Why we did it)

### **⚡️ With our combined experience, we were able to create a functioning hardware prototype that connects to a website and server accessable from any device!⚡️**

## What it does 🛒📱☑️:

CartTech allows users to drive a shopping cart and purchase groceries through the web app. Users can register an account, and then browse a list of stores. In this list of stores, users can see how many shopping carts are available in each store, and can then read the product list for each store, and view the prices and images of the items. Users can also see their order history and place new orders and the cart will automatically grab the correct grociers.

## How we built it 💻:

We used React, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap for the frontend. The backend was built with Node, Express, MongoDB, and auth0. We also used a Raspberry Pi to build the server and an Arduino for the robot.

## Challenges we ran into 💥:

- Time frame, obviously
- Authentication (login/register)
- Deployment for the frontend

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🍀🍾:

- Very few overlapping code on pull requests
- Good team work
- Implementing an organized json response on the backend
- Solid design

---

## What we learned 🧠👍:

- Improved all of our coding skills significantly

---

## What's next for CartTech 🥚🐣🐥:

---

## Software ⚛️💻:

- HTML, CSS, JS and React for the web 📱💻
- Node.js and Express.js for the backend 🖥

---

## Backend

- Authorize Users 🔐
  1. Retrieve token from browser storage
  1. Verify JWT_SECRET in process.env
  1. Authorize (next() function)
